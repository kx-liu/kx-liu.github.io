There are several bazzar bugs of math rendering encountered when writing the math equations in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is the static site generator used by my website, with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Here are some of them.

## Inline Math

- **Absolute value**: to render $\lvert x\rvert$, use `\lvert` and `\rvert` instead of `|`.

- **Curly brackets**: to render $\\{x\\}$, instead of `{x}`, use
    - `\\{` and `\\}` instead of `{` and `}` (You have to escape the backslash because there seems to be 2 levels of interpretation: jekyll and then mathjax); or
    - `\lbrace` and `\rbrace` instead of `{` and `}`.

- **Subscript problem**: to render the subscript of something that is not a single alphabet/number, use `\_` instead of `_`. For example, 
    - $(A_n)\_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ (`$(A_n)\_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$`)
    - $\mathcal{X}\_n$ (`$\mathcal{X}\_n$`)
